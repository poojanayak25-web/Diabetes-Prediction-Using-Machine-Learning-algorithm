# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-algorithm
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health metrics. Early detection of diabetes can significantly improve management and outcomes for patients, making this predictive model invaluable in preventive healthcare.

1.Predicts the probability of diabetes based on user-input health metrics.
2.Uses a machine learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset.
3.Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting health data and viewing predictions.
